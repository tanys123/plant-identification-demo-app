## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add:
   ```
   SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_here
   CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloudinary_cloud_name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_cloudinary_api_key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_cloudinary_api_secret
   ```
   
   **API Keys:**
   - **SerpApi key**: Get from [https://serpapi.com/](https://serpapi.com/)
   - **Cloudinary credentials**: Get from [https://cloudinary.com/](https://cloudinary.com/) (free tier available)

4. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

## API Integration

The app uses a two-step process for plant identification:

1. **Image Upload**: Images are uploaded to Cloudinary (professional image hosting service)
2. **Plant Identification**: The hosted image URL is sent to SerpApi's Google Lens engine

The API endpoint is located at `/api/identify-plant` and:

- Accepts base64 image data from the frontend
- Uploads image to Cloudinary with optimization and organization
- Uses the optimized URL with SerpApi Google Lens for identification
- Returns plant suggestions with titles, links, and thumbnails
- Filters results to focus on plant-related matches
- Handles errors gracefully

## Why Cloudinary?

- **Professional-grade** service used by major companies
- **Advanced image optimization** (auto WebP, quality optimization)
- **Global CDN** for fast image delivery
- **Organized storage** with folders and naming conventions
- **Secure URLs** with HTTPS
- **Generous free tier** (25GB storage, 25GB bandwidth)

## Technologies Used

- Next.js 15
- React 19
- TypeScript
